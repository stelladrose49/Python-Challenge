# Python-Challenge
Module 3 - Python Challenge

*Instructor advised that we can use Jupyter Notebook instead of .py for this Challenge*

In this project, I demonstrate my ability to read into a CSV, print results to the terminal, and export my results to a text file.

In the PyBank project, I found the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. 

In the PyPoll project, I found the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

Please enjoy!
